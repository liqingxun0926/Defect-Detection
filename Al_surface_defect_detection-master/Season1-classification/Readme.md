This Tianchi competition is the first public Computer Visual competition I participated in. 
Especially at the beginning of the Season 1, I was very unprepared. 

Thanks a lot to the [herbert-chen](https://github.com/herbert-chen/tianchi_lvcai) and 
[georgeJoe](https://github.com/xieyufei1993/TianChi-Lvcai/tree/master/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E8%B5%9B%E5%AD%A3/code), who made public their graceful code.
Itâ€™s their code that helps me get started with the competition, have a more standardized coding style and be able to explore more in Season 2.


ps For model_v4 plz refer to the above github link. Thx.
